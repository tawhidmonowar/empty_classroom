# Empty Classroom
 Empty classroom is a simple web application, it helps us to find Empty Classrooms in our University (Metropolitan University). A  project that I built as part of DBMS course (Database Management System).
 
 Few days ago, there was a junior programming contest held outside our university, and to participate in this contest all the ACM programmers of our university held a meeting. Here we were faced with a problem that is, to arrange the meeting we must find an empty classroom, where we can hold this meeting. During this search for an empty room we had to change the time and place of the meeting three times, for not being able to find it ! Because of this, most of the ACM programmers were unable to attend this meeting.

In our university there are more than 30 academic classrooms, and seven departments. To find an empty classroom, we have to check manually all the seven department's class routines, which is very tiring and time consuming.

To solve this problem I would like to introduce you to a web application, “Empty Classroom” that I developed. It is a place where the user will put a time, and date, then the app will automatically find the empty classrooms available at that time or suggest the classroom that will be available soon.

The technologies I used to build this are PHP, Laravel, My SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery. The application  will be live soon on emptyclassroom.greedycoders.com
