# Empty Classroom

Are you tired of searching for hours to find an empty classroom for your group study, meeting, or event at Metropolitan University? Say goodbye to manual checks and hello to the Empty Classroom web application!

With just a few clicks, you can now find available classrooms at the University with ease. Simply input a date and time, and let our app do the rest.

We built this application with PHP, Laravel, My SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery to make it fast, user-friendly, and accessible to all.
 
## Why Empty Classroom was Created

Few days ago, there was a junior programming contest held outside our university, and to participate in this contest all the ACM programmers of our university held a meeting. Here we were faced with a problem that is, to arrange the meeting we must find an empty classroom, where we can hold this meeting. During this search for an empty room we had to change the time and place of the meeting three times, for not being able to find it ! Because of this, most of the ACM programmers were unable to attend this meeting.

In our university there are more than 30 academic classrooms, and seven departments. To find an empty classroom, we have to check manually all the seven department's class routines, which is very tiring and time consuming.

To solve this problem I would like to introduce you to a web application, “Empty Classroom”.
